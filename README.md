## PyBank



I created a Python script for analysing the financial records of a company. The dataset is composed of two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`. 
The task is to create a Python script that analyses the records to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset

* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

* Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

* The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period


## PyPoll




I created a python script to modernise vote counting processes. The dataset is composed of three columns: `Voter ID`, `County`, and `Candidate`. The task is to create a Python script that analyses the votes and calculates each of the following:

* The total number of votes cast

* A complete list of candidates who received votes

* The percentage of votes each candidate won

* The total number of votes each candidate won

* The winner of the election based on popular vote.
